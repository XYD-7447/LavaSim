# LavaSim

The simulation requires six input files: ctl file containing model super-parameters, envir file specifying lunar environmental conditions, lava file defining lava properties, neibor file establishing neighborhood relationships (refer to Text S2 for further details), volcano file indicating vent locations and effusion rates, and zdata file representing the underground topography. All the parameters are listed in Table S2.
